## Setup, deploy, and blog post preview

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is the easiest way to deploy a Next.js app:

1. Clone this repo and edit it as needed
2. Push it on your GH account
3. Add the Vercel integration to your repo, following [this guide](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-nextjs-with-vercel)

Once you have Vercel configured, it will deploy your website on each commit on the `main` branch. It will also create a dedicated preview deployment for each pull request, meaning that you can use pull requests to add a new blog post and see how it looks.
